									**Exploring Jupyter and GitHub basics.**
				 
This lab session guides you through the foundational steps of using GitHub for version control and Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data analysis.

Part 1: Setting Up and Exploring GitHub
You will begin by creating a GitHub account and familiarizing yourself with its interface, including repositories, issues, and pull requests. The practical steps involve creating a new repository named "jupyter-exploration" and making your first commit by editing its README file. This part emphasizes basic version control practices.

Part 2: Working with Jupyter Notebooks This section focuses on accessing and utilizing Jupyter Notebooks. You have the option to use online environments like Google Colab or AWS SageMaker Studio Lab (recommended for beginners) or install Jupyter Notebook locally. You will then learn to create a new notebook, add both Markdown and code cells, and execute them. Finally, you will save your notebook, download it, and upload it to your GitHub repository using GitHub Desktop. The lab concludes with submission instructions for a two-page journal reflecting on your experience, what you learned, and any questions you have.
